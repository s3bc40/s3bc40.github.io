# Mardown resume, Jekyll Blog

My first website hosted by GitHub Pages. I made this website locally with **Jekyll** and Github Pages does the rest.

## Goal

I wanted to avoid using LateX and make a resume with **Markdown**. At the end of my journey, I finished with a little portfolio, with two version of my resume *(FR/EN)*.

I hope it will grow with more project!
