"How do I make a simple resume without using LateX?". Most of my resume these last years have been written with the web editor [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). But I wanted to avoid LateX, with the markup language [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

After some research, I found a lot of GitHub repository on the subject. Such as [markdown-cv](https://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv/) by Eliseo Papa, or [The Simplest Markdown Resume Workflow](https://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/simple-markdown-resume-with-pandoc-and-wkhtmltopdf.html) by Sonya Sawtelle. These two projects can be considered as my stepping stone to my actual portfolio.

They are both using [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to host your website, or your online resume, for free!

GitHub Pages is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is a static site generator, encoded in Ruby. Diving into the documentation and tutorials, I installed Jekyll locally and  I found a way to create my resume in Markdown (FR and EN) with my style with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), the CSS preprocessor. Then I pushed my work on my [personal repository](https://github.com/s3bc40/s3bc40.github.io).

In the end, after discovering all the possibilities of Jekyll, I wanted to keep up the good work. So why should I stop on an online resume? I can maintain a portfolio!

For this post, I did not dive into the technical part. I was just trying to make a little storytelling!

If you are interested in more information, you can contact me through the links of my ["Home Page"](https://s3bc40.github.io).

Thank you for your attention!
