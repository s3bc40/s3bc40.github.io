My first post on my custom Jekyll website. Here I am going to explain how I mangaged to go from *"I want to make an online resume"* to *"I can not stop to code and make a portfolio!"*. Story telling is an important skill to practice, so here we go!

First thing first, let me present myself casually. My name is Sebastien, a young compational bioinformatician or computer scientist (french and english people have their own definition). I am curious of every aspects of programming, which is cool because I do love to discover new domains and technologies. Other than programming, I am concerned with ecology (Zero Waste for example), and also I love my one year old dog (a sheltie!).

Now that the presentation are done, let's come back to the main subject: my resume becoming a portfolio.
